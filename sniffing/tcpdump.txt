1. run sniffing on specific interface

# tcpdump -i eth0

2. Capture Only N Number of Packets

When you run the tcpdump command it will capture all the packets for the specified interface, until you hit the cancel button. But using -c option, you can capture a specified number of packets. The below example will only capture 6 packets.

# tcpdump -c 5 -i eth0

3. Print Captured Packets in ASCII

The below tcpdump command with the option -A displays the package in ASCII format. It is a character-encoding scheme format.

# tcpdump -A -i eth0

4. Display Available Interfaces

To list the number of available interfaces on the system, run the following command with -D option.

# tcpdump -D

5. Display Captured Packets in HEX and ASCII

The following command with option -XX capture the data of each packet, including its link level header in HEX and ASCII format.

# tcpdump -XX -i eth0

6. Capture and Save Packets in a File

As we said, that tcpdump has a feature to capture and save the file in a .pcap format, to do this just execute the command with -w option.

# tcpdump -w 0001.pcap -i eth0

7. Read Captured Packets File

To read and analyze captured packet 0001.pcap file use the command with -r option, as shown below.

# tcpdump -r 0001.pcap

8. Capture IP Address Packets

To capture packets for a specific interface, run the following command with option -n.

# tcpdump -n -i eth0

9. Capture only TCP Packets.

To capture packets based on TCP port, run the following command with option tcp.

# tcpdump -i eth0 tcp

10. Capture Packet from Specific Port

Let’s say you want to capture packets for specific port 22, execute the below command by specifying port number 22 as shown below.

# tcpdump -i eth0 port 22

10. Capture Packet from Specific Port

Let’s say you want to capture packets for specific port 22, execute the below command by specifying port number 22 as shown below.

# tcpdump -i eth0 port 22

12. Capture Packets from destination IP

To capture packets from the destination IP, say you want to capture packets for 50.116.66.139, use the command as follows.

# tcpdump -i eth0 dst 50.116.66.139
