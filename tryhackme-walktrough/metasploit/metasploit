While using the Metasploit Framework, you will primarily interact with the Metasploit console. You can launch it from the AttackBox terminal using the msfconsole command. The console will be your main interface to interact with the different modules of the Metasploit Framework. Modules are small components within the Metasploit framework that are built to perform a specific task, such as exploiting a vulnerability, scanning a target, or performing a brute-force attack.

Before diving into modules, it would be helpful to clarify a few recurring concepts: vulnerability, exploit, and payload.

Exploit: A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
Vulnerability: A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system.
Payload: An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want (gaining access to the target system, read confidential information, etc.), we need to use a payload. Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.
Modules and categories under each one are listed below. These are given for reference purposes, but you will interact with them through the Metasploit console (msfconsole).
